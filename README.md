# Datagrid Project

This project is a Next.js application that leverages TypeScript, React, and CSS Modules to create a dynamic datagrid component. The datagrid is designed to display a list of items with their respective details, allowing users to select and download specific data.

## Technologies Used

* **Next.js**: A popular React-based framework for building server-rendered, statically generated, and performance-optimized websites and applications.
* **TypeScript**: A statically typed, superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to improve the development experience.
* **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces and can be used for developing single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications.
* **CSS Modules**: A CSS file in which all class names and animation names are scoped locally by default.

## Styling

The project utilizes CSS Modules for styling, which allows for modular and reusable CSS code. The styles are defined in separate CSS files, each corresponding to a specific component. This approach ensures that styles are scoped to their respective components, reducing the risk of style conflicts and making maintenance easier.

## Datagrid Component

The datagrid component is the core feature of this project. It is designed to be highly customizable and interactive, allowing users to select specific data items and download them. The component is built using React and leverages TypeScript for type safety and better code maintainability.
